## v25.2.1 on 2025-08-28

  - Added support for Spock 5.0.1:

    - Fixes a bug where updating a row that was inserted in the same transaction may use an incorrect timestamp for the inserted row and treat it as being newer than the update, resulting in the update not getting applied on other nodes.

  - Adds a check which prevents upgrading to spock 5 if `spock.enable_ddl_replication` is `enabled`.
  - Resolved an issue where upgrade compatibility checks would not fire when using `./pgedge install`.
  - Updated ACE to provide meaningful error messages if tables are empty during table-diff or Merkle tree operations.

## v25.2.0 on 2025-08-20

  - pgEdge Platform now supports Spock version 5.0; this is the default version.

  - The CLI now supports the latest PostgreSQL minor versions: 17.6, 16.10 and 15.14
  - Platform 25.2 now includes Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for all distributed components, enhancing transparency, compliance, and security auditing.
  - Migrated install/package repository to `downloads.pgedge.com`.

  ACE:

  - Merkle tree operations now honor the Postgres server's configured isolation level (instead of forcing repeatable read).
  - Improved data type handling in diff report generation.

  Bug Fixes:
  
  - Setting a custom `data` directory during setup now properly supports directories with spaces in the name.
  - The `json-create` and `json-validate` commands now allow hostnames in cluster configurations.

  - Fixed an issue where LD_LIBRARY_PATH needed to be set when invoking pgBackRest directory.
  - Released new package versions for various components.

## v25.1.0 on 2025-07-09

  - You can now use the `pg_data` flag with the [setup](../platform/pgedge_commands/setup.md) command and in your [cluster.json](../platform/installing_pgedge/json.md) file to specify a non-default location for your Postgres `data` directory.

  - ACE functionality now includes experimental support for Merkle trees. This feature significantly enhances the performance of ACE on large tables.

## v25.0.0 on 2025-06-04
 CLI

  - Introduction of the [json-create command](../platform/installing_pgedge/json.md) to simplify configuring a standard cluster with Spock, ACE, and pgBackRest deployed and replicating. This command invokes [a script](../platform/installing_pgedge/json.md#creating-a-cluster-configuration-file) that prompts you for input about your cluster.
 
  - Enhanced behavior of the cluster module's add-node command. If the source node is configured to use pgBackRest, add-node will use the configured repository from the source node for the target node.  pgBackRest configuration options specified in the target node JSON file are configured on the target node after the add-node process completes.  If a valid backup exists in the source nodeâ€™s configured pgBackRest repository, the backup will be used for the add-node operation rather than creating a new backup. 
 
  - Improvements to the `cluster` module `json-validate` function that allow you to validate additional configuration details, populate default values when not present, and support updating the cluster JSON configuration in place.
 
  - Addition of the `cluster app-concurrent-index` function; the function allows you to create concurrent indexes on all of the nodes in a cluster when AutoDDL is enabled.
 
  - Improvements to `cluster remove-node`; clusters with multiple databases will now properly manage subscriptions and node clean up in each database.
 
  - Enhanced AutoDDL behavior; if AutoDDL is enabled in the cluster configuration, AutoDDL will only be set to `on` for the first database during cluster setup.
  
ACE Improvements
  
  - ACE now supports scheduling automated `ace table-diff` and `ace repset-diff` operations.
  
  - ACE adds an auto-repair feature that allows you to schedule repairs for INSERT-INSERT conflicts.
  
  - ACE adds support for a SQL clause that allows you to run `ace table-diff` (with the `-t` or `--table-filter` option) on a subset of rows.
 
  - ACE now (optionally) returns colorized diff reports in HTML format (with the `-o` or `--output-html` option).

  - ACE adds support for client-cert based authentication for ACE modules.

  - ACE improves the behavior of `ace schema-diff` for both tables and objects.

  - ACE adds support for the  `--insert-only` and `--bidirectional` options to `ace table-repair`.

Bug Fixes

  - Fixes an issue where selinux configuration could prevent enabling AutoDDL in the spock configuration for a node when using the cluster module.

  - Fixes an issue where Postgres might not be correctly stopped when using the cluster remove command.

  - Fixes an issue where PostGIS fails to install on certain amd64-based systems.

  - Fixes an issue where the `pgedge setup` command removed a non-empty data directory while creating a sym link for /data.  The contents of the data directory will now be moved to /data before the sym link is created.
