# Installing ACE

ACE is a supporting component for pgEdge Distributed Postgres. You can install ACE on a cluster node, or you may wish to install ACE on a management system that is not a member of a cluster; the following steps provide details:

1. Navigate to the directory where ACE will be installed and invoke the installer with the command: 

    `python3 -c "$(curl -fsSL https://downloads.pgedge.com/platform/repos/download/install.py)`

2. Create a directory named `cluster` in the `pgedge` directory created by the installer.

3. [Create and update a .json file](../installing_pgedge/json.md) that describes the cluster you will be managing with ACE, and place the file in `cluster/cluster_name/cluster_name.json` on the ACE host.  For example, if your cluster name is `us_eu_backend`, the cluster definition file for this should be placed in `/pgedge/cluster/us_eu_backend/us_eu_backend.json`.  The .json file must: 

    * Contain connection information for each node in the cluster.
    * Identify the user that will be invoking ACE commands in the `db_user` property; this user must also be the table owner.

After ensuring that the .json file describes your cluster connections and identifies the ACE user, you're ready to use [ACE functions](ace_functions.md).

## Configuring ACE Preferences with the ace_config.py File

You can provide your preferences for ACE configuration options in the `ace_config.py` file (by default, created in `$PGEDGE_HOME/hub/scripts/`).  You can use the configuration to specify:

* [ACE operational preferences](#specifying-ace-operational-preferences).
* [Job and Schedule](./schedule_ace.md) information for ACE jobs.
* ACE Auto Repair options
* SSL certificate details for API users.

!!! hint

    If you're already running the ACE process, and need to modify the `ace_config.py` file, use `Ctrl+C` to stop the process before making changes.


### Specifying ACE Operational Preferences

Use properties in the `Postgres options` section of the `ace_config.py` file to specify your timeout preferences:

```bash
# Postgres options
STATEMENT_TIMEOUT = 60000  # in milliseconds
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 10  # in seconds
```

* `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` (default=60000) is equivalent to Postgres' `statement_timeout`. Aborts any query that takes more than the specified amount of time (in milliseconds). A value of 0 disables the timeout. Could be useful when running table-diff on very large tables to minimise performance impact on the database.
* `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` (default=10): Equivalent to Postgres' `connect_timeout`. Maximum time to wait while connecting, in seconds. A value of 0 means that ACE will wait indefinitely to connect. 

Use properties in the `Default values for ACE table-diff` section to specify default values for the ACE table-diff command:

```bash
#  Default values for ACE table-diff
MAX_DIFF_ROWS = 10000
MIN_ALLOWED_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000
MAX_ALLOWED_BLOCK_SIZE = 100000
BLOCK_ROWS_DEFAULT = os.environ.get("ACE_BLOCK_ROWS", 10000)
MAX_CPU_RATIO_DEFAULT = os.environ.get("ACE_MAX_CPU_RATIO", 0.6)
BATCH_SIZE_DEFAULT = os.environ.get("ACE_BATCH_SIZE", 1)
MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 1000
```

* `MAX_DIFF_ROWS` (default=10000) is the number of differences after which table-diff will abort the run. A value of 10000 means that table-diff will abort if there are more than 10000 differences between the specified nodes.
* `MIN_ALLOWED_BLOCK_SIZE` (default=1000) is the smallest allowed block size during table-diff. 
* `MAX_ALLOWED_BLOCK_SIZE` (default=100000) is the largest allowed block size during table-diff.
* `BLOCK_ROWS_DEFAULT` (default=10000) is the default number of block rows to use if nothing is specified. It attempts to read the environment variable ACE_BLOCK_ROWS, and falls back to 10000 if it is not set. Can be overridden with the CLI option `--block-rows`.
* `MAX_CPU_RATIO_DEFAULT` (default=0.6) is the number of multiprocessing workers (a float value between 0 and 1) used during table-diff is given by NUM_CPUS * MAX_CPU_RATIO_DEFAULT. Can be overridden with the CLI option `--max-cpu-ratio`.
* `BATCH_SIZE_DEFAULT` (default=1) is the number of work items to process per worker. Can be overridden with the CLI option `--batch-size`.
* `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (default=1000) is the largest batch size allowed during a table-diff.

Use properties in the `ACE Auto-repair Options` section to specify your preferences related to auto-repair:

```bash
auto_repair_config = {
    "enabled": False,
    "cluster_name": "eqn-t9da",
    "dbname": "demo",
    "poll_frequency": "10m",
    "repair_frequency": "15m",
}
```
* `enabled` is a boolean value that specifies that auto-repair should or should not be enabled; the default is `false`.
* `cluster_name` is the name of the pgEdge cluster.
* `dbname` is the name of the Postgres database that auto-repair is monitoring.
* `poll_frequency` is the interval at which to poll the `exception_log` table and populate the `exception_status` and `exception_status_detail` tables.
* `repair_frequency` is the interval at which to repair exceptions.

Table-diff scheduling options
Specify a list of job definitions. Currently, only table-diff and repset-diff
jobs are supported.

A job definition must have the following fields:
- name: The name of the job
- cluster_name: The name of the cluster
- table_name: The name of the table
OR
- repset_name: The name of the repset for repset-diff

If finer control is needed, you could also specify additional arguments in the
args field.
args currently supports the following fields:
- max_cpu_ratio: The maximum number of CPUs to use for the job. Expressed as a
  float between 0 and 1.
- batch_size: The batch size to use for the job. How many blocks does a single
  job process at a time.
- block_rows: The maximum number of rows per block. How many rows does a
  single block contain. Each multiprocessing worker running in parallel will
  process this many rows at a time.
- nodes:  A list of node OIDs--if you'd like to run the job only on specific nodes.
- output: The output format to use for the job. Can be "json", "html" or "csv".
- quiet: Whether to suppress output.
- table_filter: A where clause to run table-diff only on a subset of rows. E.g.
  "id < 10000". Note: table_filter argument will be ignored for repset-diff.
- dbname: The database to use.
- skip_tables: A list of tables to skip during repset-diff.


NOTE: For best results, stagger the jobs by at least a few seconds. Do not run
overlapping jobs

Example:
schedule_jobs = [
    {
        "name": "t1",
        "cluster_name": "eqn-t9da",

ACE Auto-repair Options

Auto-repair is a feature in ACE to automatically repair tables that are
detected to have diverged. Currently, auto-repair supports handling only
insert-insert exceptions. Handling other types of exception will need replication
information from Spock, which it either doesn't track or simply doesn't provide.
The detection happens by polling the spock.exception_status table. However, since
Spock does not automatically insert into the spock.exception_status or the
spock.exception_status_detail tables, ACE has to manually insert into them by
performing a MERGE INTO using all three tables.

How often the exception_status is populated is controlled by the poll_frequency
setting, and how often the repair happens is controlled by the repair_frequency
setting.

To enable auto-repair, set the following options:
- enabled: Whether to enable auto-repair.
- cluster_name: The name of the cluster.
- dbname: The name of the database.
- poll_frequency: The interval at which to poll the exception_log table and
  populate the exception_status and exception_status_detail tables.
- repair_frequency: The interval at which to repair exceptions.

auto_repair_config = {
    "enabled": False,
    "cluster_name": "eqn-t9da",
    "dbname": "demo",
    "poll_frequency": "10m",
    "repair_frequency": "15m",
