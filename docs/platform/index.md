# pgEdge Distributed Postgres (VM Edition)

pgEdge Distributed Postgres (VM Edition) includes a command line interface (CLI) that simplifies creation and management of a multi-master distributed pgEdge Postgres cluster in your own data center or cloud account.

For self-hosted and on-prem Installations, the CLI offers the flexibility to simply and quickly deploy distributed multi-master clusters with containers/VMs or CLI/API installers and tooling. For web and AI applications that rely on Postgres for low latency and high availability, the CLI running on a Cloud provider can ensure your applications are highly available and globally responsive. You can seamlessly deploy the CLI on:

* [Akamai](https://www.pgedge.com/landing-pages/platform-download-for-akamai)
* AWS
* Azure
* [Equinix](https://www.pgedge.com/blog/announcing-our-partnership-with-equinix-and-availability-of-pgedge-platform-on-equinix-metal)
* Google Cloud

... and more.
