# The Spock Extension

The Spock extension provides multi-master (active-active) replication for PostgreSQL versions 15, 16, and 17. The extension leverages the pgLogical and Open Source project as a solid foundation to build upon for this enterprise-class extension.

You build, install, and create the extension like any other PostgreSQL extension.  For more information about using PostgreSQL extensions, visit the PostgreSQL [website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html).

For more information about the Spock extension, review this section of the pgEdge documentation and visit the [pgEdge spock Github repo](https://github.com/pgEdge/spock#multi-master-replication-with-conflict-resolution--avoidance).
