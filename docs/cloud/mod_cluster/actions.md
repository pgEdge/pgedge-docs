# Using the Actions Menu to Modify a Cluster or Database

The `Actions` menu is a context-sensitive menu that provides a shortcut to frequently-used behaviors related to the object displayed when you open the menu.  Use options accessed via the `Actions` drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the dialog to manage your cluster or database.

For example, when opened from a cluster node the `Actions` menu might show:

![Cluster Actions menu](../images/actions_cluster.png)

Select from the options listed to:

* [Add a node](add.md) to the cluster.
* [Remove a node](drop.md#dropping-a-node-from-a-cluster) from the cluster.
* Update [Backup Stores](../cluster/backup_store.md).
* Update [Firewall Rules](../cluster/firewall.md).
* Manage [VPC Associations](../cluster/vpc_assoc.md).
* [Delete a cluster](drop.md#deleting-a-cluster).

When opened from a database menu, the `Actions` menu may include:

![Database Actions menu](../images/actions_database.png)

Select from the options listed to:

* [Backup the Database](../backup/backups.md#taking-a-backup).
* [Restore the Database](../backup/backups.md#restoring-a-backup) from backup.
* [Add the database](add.md#adding-a-database-to-a-cluster-node) to another node.
* [Remove the database](drop.md#removing-a-database-from-a-node) from a node.
* [Edit the Display Name](modify.md#changing-the-display-name-of-a-database) of the database.
* [Delete the database](drop.md#deleting-a-database).
