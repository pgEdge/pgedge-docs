# pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL: Cloud Edition

pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL: Cloud Edition (Cloud) is fully-distributed PostgreSQL, deployable across multiple cloud regions or data centers.

## Fully distributed PostgreSQL made easy

**Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud:** Deploy nodes across multiple cloud provider regions to provide optimal placement relative to your users. Cloud provisions clusters on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.

**Easy Deployment:** Creation and deployment of Cloud clusters is a breeze - simply answer a few questions, and then press a button to deploy your cluster in the cloud.

**Control and Monitoring:** Manage and monitor your Cloud cluster from a web dashboard, or alternatively via API and command line interface.

**Configuration, Management, and Security:** Cloud saves you time configuring and managing infrastructure and databases. Your data is subject to regularly scheduled backups and continually monitored. Cloud also has a host of security features to make sure only you and your client applications access your databases.

**BYO Account:** Cloud Enterprise Edition deploys clusters and databases directly into your own cloud provider accounts. Make maximal use of your cloud providerâ€™s discount plans, while allowing your security team and their tooling to have full visibility into pgEdge infrastructure, databases and configurations.

**Latency-based Routing:** User queries are connected to the nearest database node through automatic geo-proximity routing.

**100% Pure PostgreSQL:** Compatible with the PostgreSQL ecosystem, tools, and extensions such as PostGIS, PGVector, pgCat, pgBackrest, and 20+ more.

**Edge Platform Integration:** Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development platforms and software such as Cloudflare Workers, Terraform, Vercel, and Fastly.
